### ELIXIR AAI {#elixir-aai}

ELIXIR aims to provide a sustainable, user-friendly Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) to meet the evolving needs of all life scientists in Europe. To accomplish this, the [ELIXIR AAI Strategy](https://zenodo.org/record/148302#.WAjal5MrKEI) was agreed with the ELIXIR Heads of Nodes Committee in June 2016\.

[ELIXIR AAI documentation](https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai) on the ELIXIR website provides more practical information on the service and how to connect your service to the AAI. This work has been done as part of EXCELERATE WP4, deliverable 4.1 due July 2016\.
