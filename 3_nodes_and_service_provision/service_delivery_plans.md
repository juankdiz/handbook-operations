### Service Delivery Plans {#service-delivery-plans}

Each Node, with support from the ELIXIR Hub, will prepare a Service Delivery Plan that outlines those services that the ELIXIR Node puts forward to ELIXIR and which are funded by the Node (Node-funded Services). The Service Delivery Plan is an annex to the Collaboration Agreement concluded between the ELIXIR Hub and the Node and is approved by the ELIXIR Board.

[Guidelines for the development of Service Delivery Plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12tiehgtM11lEm6R2WhzTbhiutQgWhC3teHt0_CMVQo8/edit?usp=sharing) are available and the Hub will work together with each Node to prepare the Service Delivery Plan.
