### Governance structure {#governance-structure}

The ELIXIR Governance structure is defined in the ELIXIR Consortium Agreement.

The ELIXIR Board appoints and dismisses the ELIXIR Director who is responsible for executing board decisions. The ELIXIR Board also appoints the members of the ELIXIR Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), which advises the ELIXIR Board and the ELIXIR Director in scientific and ELSI matters. Furthermore, the Heads of Nodes Committee, comprising representatives of the ELIXIR Nodes and EMBL-EBI, gives advice to the ELIXIR Board and Director in relation to ELIXIR activities.

In addition to these committees, the ELIXIR Board may establish additional advisory bodies and form working groups where this is necessary for the proper functioning and achievement of ELIXIR’s goals, e.g. an Industry Advisory Committee.
