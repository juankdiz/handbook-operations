### Operational structure and responsibilities {#operational-structure-and-responsibilities}

The operational structure of ELIXIR consists of service Platforms and scientific Use Cases.

**ELIXIR Platforms**

ELIXIR has five operational platforms: Data, Tools, Compute, Interoperability and Training. Each platform is led by a leadership team agreed by the Heads of Nodes Committee. The platform membership consists of task leads and technical staff defined by expertise required for the delivery of platform tasks and services. ELIXIR is in the process of appointing Platform coordinators, who have the responsibility to ensure alignment and coordination of Platform activities and provide support to the leadership team.

ELIXIR Heads of Nodes document from June 2015 provides [more detailed information on ELIXIR Platforms and operational responsibilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7btK9HAXhx1ZE1Od3ROSU9RZGs/view?usp=sharing) (document due to be updated during 2017).

**ELIXIR Use Cases**

ELIXIR currently has four scientific Use Cases funded through the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project: Marine metagenomics, Plants, Rare disease and Human data. Similar to the platforms, each use case is led by a leadership team and the membership is defined based on tasks assigned to the Use Cases.

**Coordinator groups**

The [Technical Coordinators Group (TeCG)](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about/groups#technical_coordinators_group) is a group comprised of technical ELIXIR Node representatives. It identifies gaps and promotes connections among Nodes and platforms. It is the responsibility of the TeCG to explore technical opportunities and issues aiming to provide advice and recommendations. The TeCG is connected with platforms through Node technical representatives actively involved in the implementation of platforms.

The [Training Coordinators Group (TrCG)](https://www.elixir-europe.org/training/how-organised) is composed of training representatives of each of the ELIXIR Nodes. TrCG meets regularly to share information, expertise and to coordinate and lead the implementation of the ELIXIR training strategy across Europe.

The [Coordinators guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7btK9HAXhx1UE5BVWhVQXB4Xzg/view?usp=sharing) provide further detail on the role and remit of these groups (EXCELERATE milestone 12.4 due M12).
