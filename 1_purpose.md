The ELIXIR Handbook of Operations is the main source of information on ELIXIR procedures, recommendations and guidelines. A new version is released annually as part of the EXCELERATE project. In addition, the content is reviewed quarterly to ensure that the most up-to-date information is included. The handbook is aimed for the whole ELIXIR community, including all staff in ELIXIR Nodes, ELIXIR Hub staff, ELIXIR Board members and national funders.

The handbook is available on the ELIXIR Intranet and as the material evolves, it will be deeply integrated with the ELIXIR website and intranet (In collaboration with WP13).
