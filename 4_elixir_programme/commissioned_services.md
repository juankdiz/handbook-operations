### Commissioned Services {#commissioned-services}

Commissioned Services are services that generally fall under the responsibility of the

ELIXIR Hub but are carried out by the ELIXIR Nodes (including EMBL-Â­EBI) and are funded through the ELIXIR Budget. Commissioned Services are divided in two categories, short-term Implementation Studies and long-term Infrastructure Services.

The ELIXIR founding documents<sup><sup id="557827222347798-footnote-ref-2"><a href="#557827222347798-footnote-2">[3]</a></sup></sup> define Commissioned Services and there are two ELIXIR Board approved documents that set out the overall process for the selection, approval and pre-financing of Commissioned Services.
