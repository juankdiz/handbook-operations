### Implementation Studies {#implementation-studies}

The [memo on ELIXIR Implementation Studies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8in1NtGRloYMmdzQlBsN3hXbVU/view?usp=sharing) provides further information on these activities funded through ELIXIR Budget.

To connect the Implementation Studies more deeply with the ELIXIR Platforms, the Hub will no longer accept unsolicited Implementation Study proposals from Nodes. From July 2016 onwards, new Implementation Studies will be proposed in two ways:

1.  Specific technical projects put forward by the Platforms in agreement with the Hub
2.  Submitted in response to a defined Service Request prepared by the Hub together with the Heads of Nodes.

Both processes are being developed by the Heads of Nodes Working Group on “Platform Governance, including preparing annual Work Plans and the selection of Implementation Studies”.
