### The ELIXIR annual cycle {#the-elixir-annual-cycle}

Within the framework of the five-year scientific Programme, each year the annual ELIXIR Work Plan and Budget are prepared by the ELIXIR Director and approved by the ELIXIR Board. The annual Work Plan includes objectives for each ELIXIR Platform and Use Case and defines the Hub-funded activities, Commissioned Services, to be conducted each year.

The annual Work Plan and the accompanying budget are developed in an agreement with the Heads of Nodes Committee and submitted to the ELIXIR Board no later than 1 October each year.
